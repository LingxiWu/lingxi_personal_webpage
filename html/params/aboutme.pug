  P I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department of University of Virginia (UVA), working on Computer Architecture. My primary advisor is prof #[a(href='https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/') Kevin Skadron], and I'm also co-advised by prof. #[a(href='https://www.cs.virginia.edu/venkat/') Ashish Venkat]. My expected graduation date is May 2023.
  P My research interests lie broadly in Computer Architecture, memory and data storage systems, and domain-specific accelerator designs leveraging near-data-processing (NDP) technologies including processing-in-memory (PIM), processing-using-memory (PuM), in-storage-processing (ISP), etc. My research explores novel hardware and software techniques to design high-performance machines while maintaining energy efficiency for emerging big-data workloads such as bioinformatics, database, and machine learnings. Iâ€™m also interested in investigating security threats in such novel architectures.
